##  **Introduction to XPath in Selenium WebDriver**
###ðŸ”¹ What is XPath in Selenium?
- XPath (XML Path Language) is a query language used for navigating through elements and attributes in an XML or HTML document.
- In Selenium WebDriver, XPath is used to locate elements on a web page when other locators like ID, Name, or Class are not sufficient or dynamic.

###ðŸ”¹ Why XPath is Needed in Selenium?
- Precise Element Location â€“ Helps in locating elements that donâ€™t have unique IDs or class names.
- Handles Dynamic Elements â€“ Useful when attributes are dynamic and change on each page load.
- DOM Navigation â€“ Can traverse up and down the DOM tree (parent â†’ child, child â†’ parent).
- Flexible and Powerful â€“ Allows complex queries using functions, conditions, and operators.
